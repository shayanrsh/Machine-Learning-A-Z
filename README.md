# Machine Learning Course üß†
This repo contains my code and work for the [Machine Learning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy, taught by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. The course covers the theory and practice of various machine learning techniques, such as regression, classification, clustering, natural language processing, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. The course also teaches how to use Python and R to implement machine learning algorithms and projects.

## What I'm learning üìö
- The basics of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
- The differences and applications of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning.
- The most common machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, k-means, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, and artificial neural networks.
- The latest advances and trends in machine learning, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, generative adversarial networks, and Q-learning.
- The best practices and tips for machine learning, such as cross-validation, regularization, hyperparameter tuning, and debugging.

## What I'm achieving üèÜ
- I'm gaining a solid foundation and understanding of machine learning and its applications in various domains and industries.
- I'm developing practical skills and experience in using Python and R for machine learning projects, such as data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- I'm building a portfolio of machine learning projects that demonstrate my knowledge and abilities, such as predicting house prices, classifying images, generating text, and playing games.
- I'm earning a certificate of completion from Udemy that validates my learning and achievement. üéì
